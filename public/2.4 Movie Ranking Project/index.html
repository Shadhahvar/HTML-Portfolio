 <h2>My best 3 movies</h2>

 <hr />

 <h3>The Village</h3>

 <p>
    No movie better conveys Halloween's every ounce of mood and atmosphere better than this one, and it does it all without a single witch, jack-o-lantern, or any of the other usual tropes.
 </p>

 <h3>Tenet</h3>

 <p>
    A film that experiments, and even plays, with every facet of film as a story telling medium, and succeeds and surprises in each of its aims.
 </p>
    
<h3>The Thing</h3>

<p>
    What masquerades as the pinnacle of practical effects horror is revealed, on closer inspection, to in fact be the greatest who-dunnit of all time.
